## Project details

Because many people die during COVID times. We need to find a burial ground which has a vacancy.

We create data that displays vacancies in graveyards.
Users can check and decide to which graveyard they need to take a dead person.

This project "Graveyard vacancy tracking system" is a project made to help people all the time,
especially during COVID times. A graveyard is a place where dead bodies are either buried or
burnt. Because many people die during COVID times, we need to find a burial ground that has a
vacancy. \
This project is about a web application which shows vacancies in all the graveyards nearby. We
create data that displays vacancies in graveyards. Users can check and decide to which graveyard
they need to take a dead person. Because of the high number of COVID cases and high
population, this project is very useful in India.

Users would be able to use the website from any
device. Website administrators, graveyard officials, and government officials would be able to
register and log in to the website and edit the data.

It will also display a Google Maps link so that people can open and navigate directly
on the map. All the possible cyber attacks would be prevented.

The project will be made with the MERN stack. MongoDB for database, ReactJS for frontend,
ExpressJS and NodeJS for the backend. The interaction between frontend and backend can be
done with either HTTP APIs or Web Sockets.
